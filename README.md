# Spectral Clustering and Network Analysis of the Cryptocurrency Market
## Project Description
Our project replicates Kwapień et al.'s network analysis of the foreign exchange (FX) market and applies similar statistical analysis to the cryptocurrency market. Kwapień et al. clusters the time series data of 63 currencies and assets using a filtered correlation matrix method and produces both fixed-time and time-dependent eigenspectra graphs. Using the eigenspectra graphs, the authors identify those currencies heavily ``coupled'' with the FX market as a whole and how those coupling relationships change over time. We subsequently apply a similar clustering method to 18 of the most heavily traded cryptocurrencies and produce both fixed-time and time-dependent eigenspectra graphs. In addition to the filtered correlation method used by Kwapień et al., we also implement spectral clustering to analyze the data. In Section 3, we introduce spectral clustering and discuss its superiority over traditional clustering methods such as k-means and single linkage when analyzing time series data. In Section 4 we assess the significant ways in which the cryptocurrency market differs from the FX market and note interesting observations in the data and suggest possible explanations in real world events. In Section 5 we discuss avenues for future research given our findings and questions generated as a result.
