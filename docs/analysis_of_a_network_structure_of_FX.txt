Abstract We analyze structure of the world foreign currency exchange (FX) market
viewed as a network of interacting currencies. We analyze daily time series of FX data
for a set of 63 currencies, including gold, silver and platinum. We group together all
the exchange rates with a common base currency and study each group separately.
By applying the methods of filtered correlation matrix we identify clusters of closely
related currencies. The clusters are formed typically according to the economical and
geographical factors. We also study topology of weighted minimal spanning trees for
different network representations (i.e., for different base currencies) and find that in
a majority of representations the network has a hierarchical scale-free structure. In
addition, we analyze the temporal evolution of the network and detect that its structure
is not stable over time. A medium-term trend can be identified which affects the USD
node by decreasing its centrality. Our analysis shows also an increasing role of euro in
the world’s currency market.

1 Introduction
There are at least two reasons for analyzing the global foreign exchange (FX) market. First, this is the world’s largest and most important financial market, completely
decentralized, extending over all the countries, with the highest daily trading volume
reaching trillions of US dollars. Second, the FX market’s dynamics seems to be more
complex than any other market’s. The absence of an independent reference frame makes
the absolute currency pricing difficult or even impossible: one has to express a given
currency’s value by means of some other currency which, in turn, is also denominated
only in currencies. Moreover, apart from its internal dynamics, the global nature of
the FX market implies sensitivity to current situation on other markets in all parts
of the world. These properties together with the triangle rule [1] which links mutual
exchange rates of three currencies are among the factors responsible for a highly correlated structure of Forex.
Correlations allow one to view the FX market’s structure as a network of interacting
exchange rates. In this case the exchange rates are treated as network nodes and
are linked with their neighbours via edges with weights proportional to the coupling
strength. And although the exact nature of these interactions remains unexplained,
it is justified to assume that they are strongly nonlinear. This indicates that the FX
market may actually constitute a complex network.
An analysis of the currency exchange network can provide us with knowledge of the
structure of the market and about a role played in it by each particular currency. We
put stress on quantification of a currency’s importance in the world financial system
and on tracking its subtle changes as the market evolves in time. We achieve this by
employing the well-known methods of correlation matrix (CM) and minimal spanning
trees (MST). However, one has to be aware that both these methods, although simple
and effective, are linear and thus they detect only a part of interactions between the
exchange rates; nonlinear contributions to the internode couplings are neglected.
An exchange rate assigns value to a currency X by expressing it in terms of a
base currency B. In general, each currency can be a base for all other ones. Since
different currencies may have different internal dynamics related to domestic economy,
inflation, and sensitivity to events in other countries and markets, behaviour of the
exchange rates is strongly dependent on a particular choice of the base. What follows,
there is no absolute correlation structure of the FX network; its structure depends
largely on the base currency.

2 Methodology and Results
2.1 Data and nomenclature
We analyze daily data [2] for a 63-element set comprising 60 actual currencies and 3
precious metals: gold, silver, and platinum. We consider the inclusion of these metals
in our analysis as justified due to the two following reasons: First, gold and other
precious metals are historically closely related to the currency system (silver and gold
coins, the gold standard etc.). Even if at present there is no explicit relation between
the official monetary system and the precious metals, they are still perceived by many
as a convenient alternative to real currencies in times of high inflation or deep crises.
Second, we prefer to include the precious metals also because they, if treated as a

3

reference frame, can allow us to look at the actual currency market from outside. In
this context the precious metals can serve as a benchmark of being decoupled from the
market.
For denoting the currencies we adopted the ISO 4217 standard using three-letter
codes (CHF, GBP, USD etc.). Our data spans the time period of 9.5 years from 1
B
January 1999 to 30 June 2008. At a time instant t, the exchange rate B/X is RX
(t). We
B
conventionally define the exchange rate returns GX (t, ∆t) as the logarithmic exchange
rate increments over an interval ∆t = 1 day. From our basket of N = 63 currencies
B
we obtained N (N − 1) = 3906 time series GB
X = {GA (ti )}i=1,...,T of length T = 2394.
All time series were preprocessed in order to eliminate artifacts and too extreme data
points that can misleadingly dominate the outcomes; no points that deviate more than
10 standard deviations from the mean were allowed. Owing to a high quality of data,
only a few data points in total were modified accordingly.
Dealing with all the available exchange rates for 63 currencies simultaneously would
be rather inefficient due to information overload and would lead to results whose interpreting might be cumbersome. Attempts in this direction can be found elsewhere - for
example, in ref. [3]; we prefer here a more selective approach. An indirect but useful
way to get some insight into properties of an individual currency, if only a set of its
exchange rates is available, is to single out those rates in which this currency serves
as a base currency and apply a statistical approach to the data. By selecting the base
currency one associates a reference frame with this currency. Thus, the evolution of all
other currencies expressed by relevant exchange rates is the evolution in the frame in
which the base currency “rests”. In this context, a statistical analysis of the exchange
rates offers information on how the global FX market looks like from the perspective
of the base currency or, conversely, how the base currency behaves in relation to the
global market.

2.2 Correlation matrix formalism
Details of the basic correlation matrix formalism are as follows. For a set of exchange
rates sharing the same base B we calculate an N × N correlation matrix CB :
CB =

1 B B
M M̄ ,
T

(1)

where M is N × T data matrix and the bar denotes matrix transpose. Each entry
B
CX,Y
is the correlation coefficient calculated for a pair of the exchange rates B/X and
B/Y. If the exchange rates are considered as network nodes, the correlation matrix is
equivalent to the weights matrix collecting the weights of links between the nodes. The
so-defined correlation matrix is a starting point for our further calculations.
The market global correlation structure, as it is viewed from B, can be described
by the eigenspectrum of CB . Complete set of the corresponding eigenvectors viB and
eigenvalues λB
i (i = 1, ..., N − 1) can be obtained by solving the equation
B
CB viB = λB
i vi .

(2)

For a stock market it is typical that the associated correlation matrix can be decomposed into three components:
B
B
CB = CB
m + Cs + Cr .

(3)

4

Fig. 1 Eigenvalue spectra of correlation matrices calculated for a few exemplary choices of
base currency. Note diﬀerent gaps between the largest and the second largest eigenvalues in
each case. Shaded region corresponds to the Wishart ensemble of random matrices.

The first component CB
m describes a collective (market) mode characterizing the average behaviour of the whole market. CB
s describes the sectored structure of the market
B
and CB
r expresses independent behaviour of individual stocks. On a matrix level, Cm
has all its entries equal and its rank is 1, while CB
is
a
random
matrix
drawn
from
r
the Wishart ensemble. The middle term in Eq. (3) is a matrix with a typical rank
1 ≤ R ≤ 10 which contains the most interesting information on the stock market
structure [4, 5, 6].

2.3 Eigenspectra of CM for different base currencies
Taking outcomes of some earlier works [3, 7, 8, 9] into consideration we are justified to
assume that also the FX market possesses similar correlation structure which can be
decomposed into the analogous three levels of currency dependencies. To inspect this,
we calculate the CMs and derived their eigenvalue spectra for all 63 base currencies.
In each case the same scheme is reproduced: there is a collective mode represented
B
B
B
B
by the largest eigenvalue λB
1 with λ1 ≫ λ2 . Size of the gap between λ1 and λ2 is
B-dependent. A few examples can be seen in Figure 1.
Magnitude of λB
1 expresses how many exchange rates are correlated among themselves, i.e. how collective is the market. Properties of the matrix trace impose bounds
B
on the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue: 1 ≤ λB
1 ≤ Tr(C ) = N − 1. In our case the

5
B
range of the actual variability of λB
1 is narrower: 12.29 ≤ λ1 ≤ 55.0 with the extrema
reached for HKD and GHS, respectively. Figure 2 displays the corresponding λB
1 for
each B analyzed. The whole set of currencies has been divided there into four baskets
with respect to liquidity of each currency. The most important and liquid currencies
belong to Basket 1 and other liquid ones to Basket 2.
A straightforward interpretation of λB
1 points out to the fact that the larger it is,
the more coupled is behaviour of the underlying exchange rate sets. That is, for large
λB
1 comparable with N − 1, the global FX market evolves collectively in the reference
frame of B. This actually means that the evolution of B is significantly decoupled and
has its own independent dynamics not related to the global market. In such a case the
influence of this currency on other currencies is marginal if at all. What is natural, the
precious metals (XAG, XAU, XPT) as commodities qualify here, but, surprisingly, the
same is true for a few actual currencies (e.g. GHS, DZD, ZAR, BRL). Reasons for this
type of behaviour may comprise high inflation rate in the corresponding countries or
a strong regulation of the market by local financial authorities (Basket 4). It is worth
noting that no Basket 1 currency belongs to this group.
On the opposite pole (relatively small λB
1 ) there is the US dollar and a few other
currencies from different baskets (CNY, HKD, SGD etc.) In general, small values of λ1
are developed by the systems which do not display strong couplings among its elements.
Hence, evolution of the exchange rates seen from the USD perspective must be rather
decorrelated and many currencies enjoy large amounts of independence. Such a degree
of independence is not observed for any other liquid, market-valued base currencies
from Basket 1. Thus, by changing the base from one of those currencies to USD, many
explicit satellites of USD and its more delicately related companions acquire a dose of
freedom. This phenomenon is a manifestation of the leading role of USD in the global
foreign exchange system.
A careful investigation of Figure 2 suggests that healthy, freely convertible currencies generally are associated with λB
1 < 40.
Going back to Figure 1, it is evident from the eigenspectra that the FX market
might have a finer sectored structure similarly to the stock and the commodity markets [10]. For most base currencies, apart from λB
1 there are smaller eigenvalues which
also do not coincide with the spectrum predicted for the Wishart matrix ensemble by
the random matrix theory [11] (see the shaded region in Figure 1). A possible way to
extract information on a more subtle structure of the FX market would be removing
B
the market component CB
m from the matrix C , since it absorbs a significant fraction
of the total variance of signals and suppresses other components. However, we prefer
here an alternative approach, based on direct removing of specific exchange rates.
It is well known that due to strength of the associated economies and the investors
confidence, the US dollar and euro are the most influential currencies. Their significant
impact on other currencies is manifested in the network representation of the FX
market by a key positions of the nodes representing the exchange rates involving at
least one of these currencies [7, 8, 12]. For all choices of B, satellite currencies of either
USD or EUR have their exchange rates strongly correlated with B/USD or B/EUR.
This implies that, from a point of view of a given base currency, the collective behaviour
of the market expressed, e.g., in terms of the repelled λB
1 is, at least in part, an effect
of these correlations. In order to get more insight into subtle dependencies among the
exchange rates, now masked by the USD- and EUR-induced correlations, these two
groups of couplings have to be removed. This can be accomplished by subtracting
the USD- and EUR-related components from each original signal B/X by least square

1 for diﬀerent base currencies. All 63 currencies are distributed
among 4 baskets deﬁned by a currency’s liquidity and its freedom of trading. Basket 1 contains
the most liquid, freely convertible currencies, while Basket 4 contains only fully regulated
and/or non-convertible ones.

i = 1, ..., N − 1.

(4)

The residual component ǫB
X (t) is just the exchange rate (B/X)’ linearly independent of
B/Y.
For a given B, we apply the above procedure to each exchange rate B/X twice:
first for Y=USD, then for Y=EUR. Of course, if B=USD or B=EUR, Eq.(4) is applied
only once, since the cases of the EUR/EUR and USD/USD rates are trivial. The
′
correlation matrix C B constructed from the signals ǫB
X (t) can again be diagonalized
and its eigenspectrum can be calculated. Figure 3 shows the so-modified eigenspectra
for the same base currencies as in Figure 1. Clearly, now there is no collective market
mode for USD, EUR, GBP and CHF. This means that, for this group of base currencies,
the entire collectivity of the market, as seen in the corresponding values of λB
1 in Figure
2, stems from the couplings between USD and its satellites and between EUR and its
satellites. No other factor contributes here. The eigenspectra with some eigenvalues
which still do not fit into the predicted range for the random matrices do not show any
considerable differences between different base currencies. This observation, however, is
not valid for JPY, XAU and GHS (Figure 3). Here the largest eigenvalue deviates more

from the rest of the spectrum, although not so strongly as in Figure 1. This residual
collective behaviour can be explained by the existence of a significantly populated
cluster of currencies which survived the process of removing the B/USD and B/EUR.

2.4 Cluster structure of the FX market
The residual correlations which develop the non-random structure of the CM eigenspectra in Figure 3 lead to the existence of currency clusters which previously were
masked by the dominating nodes of USD and EUR. Identification of these clusters can
be carried out with help of a simple method of discriminating threshold applied to CM
entries [6]. The procedure is as follows: we stepwise change the threshold p from its
maximal value p = 1 down to 0 or even below 0. For each value of p we preserve only
′
B
those matrix entries that obey the inequality CX,Z
> p and substitute zeros otherwise.
Then we count the clusters of at least two exchange rates. We define clusters as the
disjoint sets of all residual exchange rates (B/X)’ that are linked by a non-zero matrix
entries to at least one cross-rate (B/Z)’, Z6=X.
Obviously, for p = 1 there is no cluster and for sufficiently small p there is exactly
one cluster comprising all N −1 exchange rates. On the other hand, for the intermediate
values of p the number of clusters varies and may exceed 1. In order to identify the
finest possible cluster structure of the market and to identify the exchange rates that

form each cluster, we fix the threshold at p = pc for which the number of clusters is
stable and close to a maximum.
Figure 4 shows the clusters that have been found for the same six base currencies
as in Figures 1 and 3 (in all Figures we label nodes, i.e., the exchange rates B/X, only
with the term currency X, dropping the base B, since B is common to all exchange
rates in a particular network representation). The cluster structure of the FX network
is considerably stable. There are clusters, like the Middle East cluster AED-BHD-JOD-

9

KWD-SAR and the commodity-trade-related cluster AUD-NZD-(CAD)-(ZAR), which
are present in all network representations, there are also ones which can be found only
in some representations (e.g. the Central European cluster CZK-HUF-PLN-SKK, the
Scandinavian cluster NOK-SEK, and the precious metals cluster XAG-XAU-XPT).
In general, among the analyzed network representations there are two dominating
patterns of the cluster structure: the first one for CHF, EUR, GBP and USD, and the
second one for JPY, XAU and GHS. This overlaps with the two different patterns of
the eigenvalue spectra shown in Figure 3. Our results show that the currencies group
together primarily according to geographical factors, but sometimes also according to
other factors like, for example, the commodity trade.

2.5 Minimal spanning tree
A useful tool in analysis of the structure of a network is the minimal spanning tree
method (MST), which allows one to describe and show the most important features
of the network structure graphically in a compact form. For example, the B-based
currency network is a fully connected undirected network with N − 1 nodes and (N −
1)(N − 2)/2 connections; the minimal spanning tree graph in this case has the same
number of nodes but only N − 2 connections.
The method is based on a metric dB
X,Y defined on the entries of the correlation
matrix by the formula:
q
dB
X,Y =

B ).
2(1 − CX,Y

(5)

In our case this quantity measures the distance between two exchange rates B/X and
B/Y. For completely correlated signals dB
X,Y = 0 and for completely anticorrelated ones
B
dX,Y = 2. MST is then constructed by sorting the list of distances calculated for all
pairs (X,Y) and by connecting the closest nodes with respect to dB
X,Y in such a manner
that each pair of nodes is connected exactly via one path. Each edge represents a link
between this node and its closest neighbour. Detailed instructions can be found e.g.
in [13]. MST assigns to each node a measure of its importance in a hierarchy of nodes:
a node is more significant if it has a higher degree K, i.e. has more edges attached to
it or, in a case of weighted networks, has edges with high weights.
The complete minimal spanning tree for the GBP-based network is plotted in Figure 5(a). This choice of B allows us to observe the most complete cluster structure
(see Figure 4(b)). In agreement with our remark from the previous section, the most
important node is the node related to USD with a degree K = 17 (it is directly linked
to 28% of nodes). Other important nodes are HKD (K = 6), SGD and EUR (K = 5),
as well as BHD, AUD, DKK and MYR (K = 4). Some edges are particularly strong
(heavy lines in Figure 5) which typically indicates that one of the associated currencies is artificially pegged to the other. This is the case, for instance, of DKK-EUR,
HKD-USD, MYR-USD and so on. Pegs lead to a situation in which certain nodes,
in fact primarily coupled to EUR or USD, are effectively connected to less important
currencies as DKK or HKD. This is why HKD has a larger multiplicity in Figure 5(a)
than EUR, and a few other nodes have significant degrees even if they do not belong
to the group of major currencies (BHD is a striking example here). Without this effect
both USD and EUR would have a much larger value of K.
In order to avoid this spurious phenomenon of absorbing a fraction of centrality of
the major currencies by their satellites, we single out only those exchange rates GBP/X

which involve independent currencies, i.e. such currencies which, in the analyzed interval of time, were not explicitely pegged to other monetary units. Figure 6 shows the
corresponding MST comprising 41 nodes. Now the tree looks different. The USD node
is even more central (K = 19, direct links with 40% of nodes) than for the full set of
currencies in Figure 5(a), and it is followed by EUR (K = 5), SGD (K = 5) and AUD
(K = 4). This better reflects the role played by USD, EUR and AUD in the world’s
currency system. SGD, which is here the least important unit, owes its localization in
the MST to its specific basket-oriented regulation.
Figures 5(a) and 6 show that the currency network has a hierarchical structure,
which supports earlier findings [7, 8, 12]. These graphs, however, do not allow to observe
the clustered structure discussed in the previous section. However, by neglecting the
influence of the GBP/USD and GBP/EUR exchange rates (Eq.(4)), most clusters can
easily be revealed. Indeed, in Figure 5(b) the cluster of AUD-CAD-NZD, as well as
the ones of the Maghreb currencies, the Central European currencies, the Middle East
currencies, the South-East Asian currencies, and the precious metals are identifiable.
The hierarchical structure of the original network is lost here, however: the incomplete
network of Figure 5(b) resembles rather a random graph.
In order to be able to say something more on the MST topology, we calculate
a distribution of the node degrees for the GBP-based network from Figure 5(a). We

count the number of nodes of the same degree and calculate the cumulative distribution
function for this quantity. This empirical distribution resembles the scale-free powerlaw behaviour, thus we attempt to fit the power function and evaluate the scaling
exponent α. For the GBP-based MST α = 1.55 ± 0.16.
It is worthwhile to compare the scaling exponents for the cumulative distributions
of the node degrees using different base currencies. Typically, the scaling relations
exhibited by the c.d.f.s are of statistical significance and the corresponding scaling
exponents can be estimated with only a small error [12]. The exponents have values in
the range 1.37 ≤ α ≤ 1.96 but a vast majority of values do not exceed 1.66. Only for five
base currencies α > 1.66: this happens for USD (1.96 ± 0.24), CNY (1.93 ± 0.19), and
HKD (1.89 ± 0.27). In all these cases the scaling quality is also poor, as the significant
statistical errors indicate. Both HKD and CNY are tied to USD and therefore they
mimic its evolution. Moreover, they develop a small collective eigenvalue λB
1 (Figure
2), which is also a property inherited from the US dollar. This result suggests that the
base currencies with high values of α are associated with the network representations
that are more random than typical hierarchical networks. It occurs that the exponent
averaged over all base currencies ᾱ = 1.53 ± 0.11, in agreement with the theoretically
derived value of 1.61 for a hierarchical network of the same size [20, 21]. The above
results are displayed in Figure 7.

2.6 Temporal stability of the market structure
Earlier works showed that the currency networks, expressed by the MST graphs, are
sensitive to current market situation - for instance, to which currencies are most active
at the moment [3, 8]. However, despite this fact a majority of network edges were
reported to be rather stable.
As an example of the MST variability, in Figure 8 we present the exemplary GBPbased trees for the two disjoint and mutually distant time intervals of three years:
01/1999-12/2001 (Interval 1) and 07/2005-06/2008 (Interval 2). To eliminate the spurious wandering of nodes between the major currencies and their satellites, we restricted
the network to 41 independent exchange rates (as it was the case for the entire period
in Figure 6). In fact, the structure of MSTs in both panels of Figure 5 is different.
In the more recent Interval 2 (Figure 5(b)) the USD node has smaller centrality than
in the earlier Interval 1 (Figure 5(a)); its degree dropped from K = 21 to K = 17.
In addition, the tree in Figure 5(b) has more extended branches than its counterpart
in Figure 5(a). However, neither of the trees lacks the overall hierarchical structure,
which seems to be a stable property of the network under study.
Figure 9 shows cumulative distributions of the node degrees for two different network representations and for the same two intervals of time. A difference of the MST
structures can be seen for both Bs. For Interval 1 the cumulative distribution has fatter
tails while for Interval 2 the c.d.f. decreases more quickly and develops thinner tails. It
is debatable whether we observe any scaling behaviour of the tails, but, nevertheless,
in order to describe the different shapes of the distributions we calculate the optimal
scaling exponents. For Interval 1 we obtain αGBP = 1.50 and αEUR = 1.42, while
the analogous numbers for Interval 2 are equal to 1.54 and 1.59, respectively. In both
representations there is a clear increase of the scaling exponent’s value.
Quantitative characterization of the changes in the MST network structure with
time can also be possible by observing the temporal variability of the largest eigenvalue

annual periods of approximately 250 trading days (with an exception for the last period
of 2008, which is only 6 months long) and calculate the correlation matrices CB and
their eigenspectra for each period and for each base currency. Results are shown in
Figure 10. While the upper edge of the eigenvalue ladders remains almost unchanged
over time with λB

rungs of the ladder, the global market is nowadays more collective than it used to be
7-9 years ago. This, in turn, means that the set of currencies which previously were
tightly related to the US dollar, now seems to be less populated. Interestingly, although
USD permanently remains at the bottom of the ladder, sometimes it loses its extreme
position to the advantage of other currencies like HKD or SGD. However, even then
USD remains the currency with the lowest λ1 among all the major ones from Basket 1.
Since during the analyzed period both λUSD
and λEUR
significantly changed their

values indicating a lack of stability of the network in different representations (Figure
10), it is worthwhile to inspect the behaviour of the largest eigenvalue for these and
other base currencies with a better temporal resolution. We improved it by applying a
moving window of length of about 6 months (126 trading days) which was shifted by
1 month (21 trading days).
The corresponding behaviour of λB

different baskets is presented in three panels of Figure 11. The most interesting obser(t) gradually decreases (Figure 11(a)). This

without any systematic trend between 14 and 20. On the other hand, the two other
European major currencies: CHF and GBP, while sometimes closely mimicking the
transient short-term behaviour of λEUR
(t), do not follow its long term evolution. JPY

is a rather different case: after a decreasing trend of λJPY
between 1999 and 2003 and
1
after a period of stabilization in 2004-2006, JPY now displays strong oscillations which
elevated its largest eigenvalue to a level typical for less influential currencies (Baskets
2-4) that are decoupled from the global market. Figures 11(b)-(c) show λB
1 for a few
liquid and illiquid currencies from Baskets 2, 3 and 4. A characteristic property of this
group of currencies is strong short-term variability of the largest eigenvalue which can
be seen for almost all choices of B except SGD and CNY.

3 Summary
We presented outcomes of a study of the FX network structure based on daily data collected for the interval 01/1999-06/2008. These outcomes allow us to draw the following
principal conclusions:
(i) The currency network structure depends on a choice of base currency and the
associated reference frame. On one hand, a network based on a currency which is decoupled from the rest of the currencies and display an independent behaviour shows a
highly correlated, rigid structure. On the other hand, a network viewed from the USD
perspective (or the perspectives of its satellites) has a richer structure with less corre-

18

lations and more noise. For typical currencies the networks has intermediate structure
that can be classified between these two extremes. However, for a vast majority of currencies, the MST graphs share the same topology quantified in terms of the node degree
distribution. We found that these networks show a signature of scale free networks. An
extreme opposite case are the USD-based, CNY-based and HKD-based networks which
have topology deviating from scale-free in direction of a random network.
(ii) From a perspective of a typical currency, the FX network is dominated by two
strong clusters of nodes related to USD and to EUR. The former comprises usually
the Latin American and the South-East Asian currencies, while the latter consists of
the European and the Maghreb ones. There are also other smaller groups of nodes
forming clusters related to geographical or economical factors, but normally they are
masked by the dominating two clusters and can be seen in full detail only after removing the USD and EUR nodes from the network. Among those secondary clusters we
distinguish the cluster of Middle East currencies, the cluster of Canadian, Australian
and New Zealand dollars (sometimes accompanied by the South African rand, which
couples currencies involved in trade of various commodities), the cluster of Central
European currencies, and the cluster of precious metals. Weaker links couple also the
Scandinavian currencies, the Latin American currencies, and the South-East Asian
currencies.
(iii) We found that the FX network is not stable in time. Over a few past years the
currency network underwent a significant change of its structure with the main activity
observed in the neighbourhood of USD and EUR. The USD-related cluster released its
ties, allowing some nodes to acquire more independence. At the same time the USDbased network becomes more correlated, what is a different manifestation of the same
phenomenon. On the other hand, the EUR node now attracts more nodes than before
and, complimentarily, the EUR-based network reveals decreasing strength of couplings.
This might be a quantitative evidence that after a transient period in which the FX
market actors treated the new European currency with a little of suspense, now more
and more of them start to rely upon it. These findings open an interesting topic for
future research.
